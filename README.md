## Description

Guidely is an application designed to allow users to host free walking tours, aiming at a more interactive user experience before, throughout, and after the tour. The front-end was developed using Flutter, and the back-end was developed using Firebase. A web server was also created using Flask, HTML, CSS and Javascript, in order to allow the administrators of the app to approve and reject tour guide applications.

## Features

Notable features include:

- Live location tracking for guides, allowing users to follow tours at their own pace.
- Voice chat during tours, enabling users to listen to guides without interruption from noisy environments.
- Text chat during tours for a more interactive user experience.
- Quizzes created by the tour guide, available after a tour session.
- Tour recommendation algorithm based on various factors.
- Custom web server for administrators to manage tour guide applications.
